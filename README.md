## Executive Summary

This project presents an automated **Sneaker Price Analysis System** that collects and compares prices from major retail platforms — primarily **Nike** and **Zappos**. It uncovers pricing trends, platform-specific differences, and market behavior for popular sneaker models through web scraping, data processing, and visualization.

From the results, **Nike sneakers average $138.63**, while **Zappos averages $102.50**, showing a **34% higher pricing gap** on Nike’s end. Visualizations confirm that Nike focuses heavily on **premium and limited editions**, while Zappos offers a **broader, budget-friendly range**.  
Premium colorways like *“Cave Stone and Black”* and *“Baroque Brown and Sail”* command the highest prices, while models with *unknown colorways* or *standard editions* tend to sell for less. These findings give a clear picture of how each platform positions itself in the sneaker market.

The full pipeline automates data scraping, cleaning, transformation, and storage, producing a ready-to-analyze dataset for Power BI or other analytics tools. By automating the collection process, the system reduces manual effort by over **90%**, ensuring reliable and up-to-date insights for **retailers, analysts, and sneaker enthusiasts** who want to track pricing, spot opportunities, or benchmark competitiveness.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a **scalable sneaker price intelligence system** that automates the collection, comparison, and analysis of sneaker prices from multiple online retail platforms.

### Key Objectives:
- **Quantify price variation** across platforms, models, and editions  
- **Detect pricing patterns** driven by brand, model, or colorway  
- **Identify resale potential** by highlighting undervalued models  
- **Provide structured data** for visualization and trend tracking  
- **Automate data updates** to replace manual, repetitive price checks  

This project demonstrates how automation and data analytics can reveal valuable pricing insights in the sneaker market. In the future, the system can be extended to include **resale platforms like StockX**, enabling full **retail-to-resale market intelligence**.
